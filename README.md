<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stellar Populations (SSP) models in the Near-infrared</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following research is presented in the series of papers and Ph.D. thesis concerning the Single Stellar Populations (SSP) models. The present information is divided in different sections:</p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a title="IRTF spectral library" href="https://github.com/Astro-SMG/IRTF_spectral_stellar_library/wiki/IRTF-spectral-stellar-library">I. Preparation of the IRTF spectral stellar library</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the first paper (Meneses-Goytia et al. 2015a, hereafter <a title="Publications" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...582A..96M/abstract">Paper I</a>) we characterised one of the model ingredients, the <em>IRTF spectral library</em>, by determining the stellar parameters of the stars and the resolution of the library, as well as the reliability of the flux calibration. In this section, we make available the stars composing the <em>IRTF spectral library</em> and their atmospheric parameters.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a title="The models" href="https://github.com/Astro-SMG/SSP_models_in_the_NIR/wiki/The-models">II. Synthesis models</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the second paper (Meneses-Goytia et al. 2015b, hereafter <a title="Publications" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...582A..97M/abstract">Paper II</a>), we introduced our modeling approach and its predictions. Here, we make the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs), the integrated colours and line-strength indices available.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a title="Early-type galaxies" href="https://github.com/Astro-SMG/SSP_models_in_the_NIR/wiki/Early-type-galaxies/">III. Early-type galaxies</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The third paper (Meneses-Goytia et al. 2019c, hereafter Paper III) will show the comparisons of our models with observations of early-type galaxies from full-spectrum fitting and line-strength index fitting approaches. This section is under-construction.</p>
